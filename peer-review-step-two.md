Now for the critical step: peer review synthesis.

**Your branch:** `[YOUR_BRANCH_NAME]`

**Peer branches to review:**
- `[BRANCH_PATH]` Claude
- `[BRANCH_PATH]` Grok
- `[BRANCH_PATH]` 

**Process:**

1. Re-read the original requirements from the first message in this thread
2. Review both peer codebases thoroughly against those requirements
3. Compare their approaches to your own
4. Conduct a comparative analysis (strengths, weaknesses, trade-offs, blind spots) across all three implementations
5. Decide what to adopt, adapt, or ignore—then implement those changes

**Standards:**
- Be objective. These are peers you respect; assume their choices were intentional.
- Be rigorous. Don't make changes lightly—justify each one against the original requirements.
- Be thorough. Review structure, logic, edge cases, and style.

**Output:**
Produce a complete handoff prompt for another agent that includes:
- Your branch name
- Summary of original requirements
- Analysis of all three approaches
- Decisions made and rationale
- Final implementation state
