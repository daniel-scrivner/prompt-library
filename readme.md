# prompt-library

A collection of reusable prompts for AI-assisted development workflows.

## Prompts

### Peer Review Workflow

A two-step process for having AI agents review and synthesize work across multiple implementations.

- **[peer-review-step-one.md](peer-review-step-one.md)** - Self-review prompt for finalizing work before peer review
- **[peer-review-step-two.md](peer-review-step-two.md)** - Peer review synthesis prompt for comparing and integrating multiple implementations

## Usage

Copy and adapt these prompts for your own AI-assisted workflows. The peer review prompts work well when running parallel implementations across different AI models, then synthesizing the best approaches.
